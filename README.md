# Revvi - F1 Telemetry Intelligence

## 🏁 Project Vision

**Revvi** is an AI agent created by **Hasin Raiyan** that focuses on democratizing Formula One telemetry for everyone, making professional-level race data easier to understand without requiring engineering experience.

Revvi is not designed to act like a strategist or make race predictions. Instead, the agent helps users understand real telemetry data such as speed traces, throttle and brake overlays, gear shifts, corner-by-corner behavior, traction usage, and sector performance.

## 🎯 About Revvi

The purpose of Revvi is to translate raw telemetry into clear insights about what a driver is doing, why certain moments in a lap happened, and how different drivers compare in specific corners or sectors. Revvi explains engineering concepts in simple language, helps fans learn how to read telemetry, and breaks down race or qualifying behavior using real data that users select.

The agent's reasoning follows standard race engineering logic. It interprets patterns like early braking, late apexing, inconsistent throttle application, understeer indications, traction issues, or ERS deployment differences only when such insights are supported by the available data. Revvi does not fabricate numbers or assume telemetry that is not provided.

In the larger project, Revvi sits at the center of a telemetry-driven analysis interface built on top of FastF1 and custom visualizations. Users choose the year, race, session, and driver, and the system provides both the graphs and Revvi's explanations. The project aims to make the world of F1 engineering more accessible by opening up information that normally stays inside teams.
